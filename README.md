# Banking System
Welcome to the Banking System! This simple Python-based banking simulation allows users to check their balance, deposit funds, withdraw money, and exit the system—all within a user-friendly console interface. It's a great way to practice Python fundamentals while exploring real-world banking operations like data validation, financial transactions, and error handling.

# Project Overview
The Banking System provides a basic account management experience where users start with a fixed balance of $100 and can perform transactions interactively. The system ensures secure and error-free transactions through built-in validation, preventing overdrafts and invalid inputs.

# Features
✅ Real-Time Balance Tracking – Displays updated account balance after every transaction.
✅ Secure Deposits & Withdrawals – Ensures valid amounts and prevents overdrafts.
✅ Error Handling & Input Validation – Rejects invalid inputs, preventing system crashes.
✅ Intuitive User Experience – Offers clear prompts and structured menus for seamless interaction.

# Key Functions
🔹 banking_system(): Runs the entire banking system, handling user choices and transactions.
🔹 Balance Check – Displays the user’s current balance.
🔹 Deposit Money – Allows users to add funds to their account, with validation to prevent negative deposits.
🔹 Withdraw Money – Ensures withdrawals do not exceed the available balance.
🔹 Error Handling – Prevents invalid inputs and provides informative feedback.

# How to Use
1️⃣ Run the Script: Execute the program in a Python environment (python banking_system.py).
2️⃣ Enter Your Initials: Provide your initials for a personalized experience.
